## Contributing

See the

The contributing file also has tips on how to make contributions, if you
don't already know how to do that.

## Command Line Usage

Formatted text and HTML versions of the draft can be built using `make`.

```sh
$ make
```

Command line usage requires that you have the necessary software installed.  See
[the instructions](https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template/blob/main/doc/SETUP.md).

## Regenerating Examples and Draft Sections

The draft markdown uses HTML comment markers (e.g.,
`<!-- begin:... ; see README for regeneration instructions, do not edit -->` /
`<!-- end:... -->`) to delimit auto-generated sections. Content between
matching begin/end pairs is overwritten by the script and should not be
edited directly in the markdown.

The algorithm definitions, test vectors (JWKs and JWEs), and several draft
sections (algorithm tables, IANA registrations, test vectors appendix) are
generated by scripts in the `scripts/` folder. The algorithm suites are
defined in `scripts/algorithms.js`.

The generated outputs must be committed to the repository. CI runs
`node --run update` and asserts that the checkout is clean, i.e. the build
will fail if the committed content between the HTML comment markers is
out of date. After modifying the algorithm set, run the following locally
and commit the results:

```sh
# requires Node.js >=24.7.0
npm install
node --run update
```

This will:

1. Remove existing `examples/jwks/` and `examples/jwe/` directories
2. Run `scripts/jwks.js` to generate JWK key pairs for each algorithm
3. Run `scripts/jwe.js` to generate JWE test vectors (flattened JSON and compact)
4. Update the draft markdown with regenerated algorithm identifier tables,
   IANA registration entries, and test vector sections

Steps 1–3 are skipped if `scripts/algorithms.js` has not changed since
the last run. To force regeneration of examples regardless:

```sh
node --run force-update
```
