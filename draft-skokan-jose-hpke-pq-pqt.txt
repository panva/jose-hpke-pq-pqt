   Traditional (PQ/T) hybrid algorithm identifiers for use with JSON

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-jose-hpke-encrypt] defines how to use Hybrid Public Key
   Encryption (HPKE) with JSON Web Encryption (JWE).  That specification
   registers algorithm identifiers for traditional (non-post-quantum)
   KEMs based on elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman.

   This document extends the set of registered algorithms to include
   Post-Quantum (PQ) and Post-Quantum/Traditional (PQ/T) hybrid KEMs, as
   defined in [I-D.ietf-hpke-pq].  These algorithms provide protection
   against attacks by cryptographically relevant quantum computers.

   All algorithms defined in this document follow the same operational
   model as those in [I-D.ietf-jose-hpke-encrypt], supporting both
   integrated encryption (where HPKE directly protects the plaintext)
   and key encryption (where HPKE protects a Content Encryption Key).

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Algorithm Identifiers

   This section defines the algorithm identifiers for PQ and PQ/T HPKE-
   based encryption in JOSE.

3.1.  Integrated Encryption Algorithms

   The following table lists the algorithm identifiers for integrated
   encryption, where HPKE directly encrypts the plaintext without a
   separate Content Encryption Key:

       +=============+=================+=============+=============+
       | "alg" value | HPKE KEM        | HPKE KDF    | HPKE AEAD   |
       +=============+=================+=============+=============+
       | HPKE-8      | ML-KEM-768      | HKDF-SHA256 | AES-128-GCM |
       +-------------+-----------------+-------------+-------------+
       | HPKE-9      | MLKEM768-X25519 | HKDF-SHA256 | AES-128-GCM |
       +-------------+-----------------+-------------+-------------+

                                  Table 1

   HPKE-8 provides pure post-quantum security using ML-KEM-768.

   HPKE-9 provides hybrid post-quantum/traditional security by combining
   ML-KEM-768 with X25519, ensuring protection against both classical
   and quantum adversaries.

   When using integrated encryption algorithms, the "enc" (encryption
   algorithm) Header Parameter MUST NOT be present, as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-jose-hpke-encrypt].

3.2.  Key Encryption Algorithms

   The following table lists the algorithm identifiers for key
   encryption, where HPKE encrypts the Content Encryption Key (CEK):

       +=============+=================+=============+=============+
       | "alg" value | HPKE KEM        | HPKE KDF    | HPKE AEAD   |
       +=============+=================+=============+=============+
       | HPKE-8-KE   | ML-KEM-768      | HKDF-SHA256 | AES-128-GCM |
       +-------------+-----------------+-------------+-------------+
       | HPKE-9-KE   | MLKEM768-X25519 | HKDF-SHA256 | AES-128-GCM |
       +-------------+-----------------+-------------+-------------+

                                  Table 2

   Key encryption algorithms are used with the "enc" Header Parameter to
   specify the content encryption algorithm, as defined in [RFC7516].

4.  JSON Web Key Representation

   Keys for the algorithms defined in this document use the "AKP"
   (Asymmetric Key Pair) key type defined in [I-D.ietf-cose-dilithium].

   For the algorithms in this document, the "pub" parameter contains the
   base64url encoding of HPKE's SerializePublicKey() output for the
   corresponding KEM, and the "priv" parameter contains the base64url
   encoding of HPKE's SerializePrivateKey() output.

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [I-D.ietf-jose-hpke-encrypt] and
   [I-D.ietf-hpke-pq] apply to this document.

6.  IANA Considerations
